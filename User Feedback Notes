User Feedback:

Show “no results found” message when there are no results
- Should only display results if last fm has results. 
- Alternative - show YouTube results of query if nothing found from last.fm

Clicking site name should bring you back to homepage

Tell the user it’s a video that they are getting back

When error message displays, it currently does not remove when moving back to homepage or performing a new search. 
- Need to add code to hide

“Violet Crime” as search example shows only 3 tracks, only three songs on last.fm
Might want to change Top 10 Tracks to Top Tracks

Should be able to click youtube thumbnails to go to video


Is this an app that shows top ten tracks, or just a refined search of the best results found

Do I want to further refine YouTube results based on tagging

What about adding similar artists
Similar how? Popularity, famous, genre?


Get a new background, the current image fights the content
- Lower opacity of background

To fill space, add similar artists
Click the new artist would run the search, rather than make the user perform a new search


Make search bar bigger on homepage to make it main focus
- Search bar box is a bit hidden due to color - fix

Search button could tell you what it is going to find
